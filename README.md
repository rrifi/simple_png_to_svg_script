# simple_png_to_svg_script
PNG to SVG Script for Windows, portable you dont need to install anything. Very Useful if you want draw something on paint and then making it's 3D version

I made this after I started learning 3D conception, i suggest you to start www.tinkercad.com it's very good
This script allows me to draw anything on paint, then with it's SVG version, we can upload it directly on ThinkerCad and then make a 3D version
